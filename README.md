# David Ashley's SDL fire demo

This is the "fire" SDL demo from the SDL website, updated to include resizable window support and stripped of its old build scripts.

There was never a license attached to original demo, which means that it's technically "all rights reserved", but I don't think David would disapprove. Maybe I'll ask him at some point...
